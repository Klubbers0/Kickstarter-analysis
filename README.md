### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? When a kickstarter is launched in May or June they have a higher success rate. Kickstarters launched in October have a low chance of being canceled. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Goals less than 1000 have a higher chance of being successful, whereas goals between 4500-4999 have a greater chance of failing. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? It doesn't show location.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Outcomes based off of outcomes and location, outcomes and year created.
